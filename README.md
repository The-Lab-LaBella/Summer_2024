# Summer_2024

# Outline 


# Introduction

This summer, the LaBella lab has multiple trainees working in the lab. This outlines all the necessary background information and additional details you will need to get working this summer. 

You **must read this thoroughly**! It contains important safety information. 

You will **fill out your progress** on the google sheet. Each step must be signed off by Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen.

# Lab Introduction

The LaBella Lab has a **Welcome to the Lab** site where you can find all the resources necessary for the lab: https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Welcome_to_the_Lab

We also have a robust **Lab Handbook** in which you can find all the of the relevent information about expectations in the lab. https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/LaBellaLabHandbook

# Scientific Background

## The Y1000+ project
In 2024, Dr. LaBella and her colleagues in the Y000+ collaborative published a paper describing the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. The yeasts in this group contains the common lab workhorse _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_, and other yeasts used in biotechnology to create natural products and biofuels. 

Please read the manuscript, which is linked here: 

## Lab LaBella work 

One of our lab's main goals is to connect genotype to phenotype to ecology. For example, we have previously used codon optimization as a proxy for gene expression to identify a link between _GAL_-actose metabolism gene codon optimization (genome), growth rate on galactose (phenotype), and dairy environments (ecology.) Read more here: 

This work is possible because we have extensive phenotpyic data for the 1,154 yeast strains. We have information such as binary growth data on lots of carbon and nitrogen substrates. We also have growth curves (see below) for many of the yeasts on diverse carbon substrates. Importantly, we also have data about the temperature at which many of the yeasts grow. This is important because human fungal pathogens must be able to grow at human body temperature (37C). 

While we have this information for many species, there is still a significant amount of missing data in our dataset. One of the primary goals of this summer is to fill in many of the gaps we have in our dataset. This will enable even more robust analysis of this incredible dataset. 

## Yeasts

Yeasts are typically defined as single cellular fungi. Across the fungal subphylum, however, there have been multiple transitions to and from single-celled fungi. Therefore, the "yeasts" do not form a single group. When we use the word "yeast" we are referring specifically to the yeast of the Saccharomycotina subphylum. 

In our gooogle drive please read the "Who are the yeasts" PDF to learn more about who the yeasts are and why they are so cool.

# Biosafety

Our lab is registerd as a Bio-Safety Level 2 lab. This means that we are able to grow organisms, like _Candida albicans_ which can possibly infect people. If you are at an increased risk of infection we can increase your PPE protective equipment or find alternative experiments. 

To work in the lab you **must complete biosafety training**. Specifically the **Laboratory Personnel BSS** training. Instructions for how to take this course can be found here: https://research.charlotte.edu/departments/office-research-protections-and-integrity-orpi/biosafety/biosafety-training-information/

You will also need to review our specific biosafety protocol located in the google drive. 

## Essential Biosafety Rules

Here we will outline some of the most essential biosafety rules. If we observe you violating any of these rules, your access to the lab will be immediately suspended. 

- Do not enter the lab unsupervised. Exceptions must be approved by Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen
- No eating or drinking is allowed in the lab
- Do not wear lab coats, gloves, or any other protective equipment outside of the lab
- Use protective equipment (PPE) where required
- Follow all of the guidelines in the lab and institution biosafety, laboratory biosafety and enviornmental health and safety (EHS) protocols
