# Summer_2024

# Outline 


# Introduction

This summer, the LaBella lab has multiple trainees working in the lab. This outlines all the necessary background information and additional details you will need to get working this summer. 

You **must read this thoroughly**! It contains important safety information. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen.

# Scientific Background

## The Y1000+ project
In 2024, Dr. LaBella and her colleagues in the Y000+ collaborative published a paper describing the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. The yeasts in this group contains the common lab workhorse _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_, and other yeasts used in biotechnology to create natural products and biofuels.

## Lab LaBella work 

One of our lab's main goals is to connect genotype to phenotype to ecology. For example, we have previously used codon optimization as a proxy for gene expression to identify a link between _GAL_-actose metabolism gene codon optimization (genome), growth rate on galactose (phenotype), and dairy environments (ecology.)
