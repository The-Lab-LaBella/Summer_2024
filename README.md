# Summer_2024

# Outline 


# Introduction

This summer, the LaBella lab has multiple trainees working in the lab. This outlines all the necessary background information and additional details you will need to get working this summer. 

You **must read this thoroughly**! It contains important safety information. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen.

# Lab Introduction

The LaBella Lab has a **Welcome to the Lab** site where you can find all the resources necessary for the lab: https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Welcome_to_the_Lab

We also have a robust **Lab Handbook** in which you can find all the of the relevent information about expectations in the lab. https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/LaBellaLabHandbook 



# Scientific Background

## The Y1000+ project
In 2024, Dr. LaBella and her colleagues in the Y000+ collaborative published a paper describing the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. The yeasts in this group contains the common lab workhorse _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_, and other yeasts used in biotechnology to create natural products and biofuels.

## Lab LaBella work 

One of our lab's main goals is to connect genotype to phenotype to ecology. For example, we have previously used codon optimization as a proxy for gene expression to identify a link between _GAL_-actose metabolism gene codon optimization (genome), growth rate on galactose (phenotype), and dairy environments (ecology.)

This work is possible because we have extensive phenotpyic data for the 1,154 yeast strains. We have information such as binary growth data on lots of carbon and nitrogen substrates. We also have growth curves (see below) for many of the yeasts on diverse carbon substrates. Importantly, we also have data about the temperature at which many of the yeasts grow. This is important because human fungal pathogens must be able to grow at human body temperature (37C). 

While we have this information for many species, there is still a significant amount of missing data in our dataset. One of the primary
